Reflection:

I started this project after my car accident and only did it in the terminal until the terminal refused to like IPA. However, as time went on, I found how to code python into a webpage. I'm in computer science 101, and it was quite funny when we had a language assignment and my professor was skeptical with my unique code for it - I explained it was part of another project. I learned so much from this - between of course, the material, finally able to create something that if used would make my work so much better, and a whole new side of code. However, most notably, I found the branch of computational linguistics I am interested in: translation. Once you mentioned the project, I was so excited.
